# Image Manipulation

Program to manipulate images (currently restriced to jpegs) in a variey of different ways at a bit level. Completed as part of my Coding and Information Theory Independent Study.

Usage:

```sh
g++ src/main.cpp -o image
./image
```  

After runnning, simply follow the instructions in the console to select an image and what you would like to do to it. You can find the resulting images in the images folder within this project folder.
